# MazeSolvingVisualizer
A small tool for visualizing maze-solving algorithms.

## Usage
- Use the pencil/erase tool to draw delete walls
- Place a start (green box) and an end (red box) using the respective buttons
- The generate button creates a maze using a randomized depth-first search algorithm, the clear button removes all walls
- Choose an algorithm to solve the maze with the selector
- Use the play button to start visualization. While running you can pause with the same button and do one step at a time with the button to its right.
- There's an option to enable a sound while running the algorithm. Make sure, your browser is not blocking audio playback(!)


## Implemented algorithms
- Breath-first search
- Depth-first search
- A-star
- Wall-following
  - This may not work well, if there are no walls to follow
